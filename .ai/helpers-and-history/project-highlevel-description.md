### Main Problem

To hold a conversation or read effectively in a specific field of knowledge in a foreign language, it is essential to have a solid vocabulary in that field. For maximum efficiency, it is convenient to create relevant categories and populate them with words. Users should then be able to access the word list for a chosen category and switch to a learning mode, going through the words in sequence.

### Minimum Feature Set

- Users can view, edit, and delete their languages
- Users can view, edit, and delete their categories for each language
- Users can view, edit, and delete their words for each category
- Each word contains definitions in the target language, the user’s translation, and an example of usage in the target language
- AI can generate words and example sentences based on the selected category and difficulty level
- Users can browse words in a category in a full table or switch to a word-sliding (flashcard) mode
- Simple user account system

### Out of Scope for MVP

- Word learning progress tracking logic
- Admin dashboard for user management
- Tracking errors
- Mobile apps (initially only a web version)

### Success Criteria

- Users can view/edit/delete their own languages/categories/words
