### Backend and Database

- Use Supabase for backend services — authentication, database interactions, storage, and RPC.
- Follow Supabase best practices for security, RLS policies, and performance.
- Use Zod schemas to validate data exchanged with the backend.
- In server components and API routes access Supabase instances from `lib/supabase/server.ts`.
- In client components access Supabase instances from `lib/supabase/client.ts`.
- Do not import the global supabaseClient directly — always use context-aware instances (server or browser).
