## Project Structure

When introducing changes to the project, always follow the directory structure below:

- `./app` - NextJs layouts
- `./app/api` - API endpoints
- `./middleware.ts` - NextJs middleware
- `./components` - Client-side components written in React (dynamic)
- `./components/ui` - Client-side components from Shadcn/ui
- `./lib` - Services and helpers 
- `./lib/supabase` - Supabase clients, middleware and types
- `./lib/types.ts` - Shared types for backend and frontend (Entities, DTOs)
- `./assets` - static internal assets
- `./public` - public assets

When modifying the directory structure, always update this section.

## Coding practices

### Guidelines for clean code

- Use feedback from linters to improve the code when making changes.
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
